## Gameplay

Each round has 3 phases:

### 1. Factory Offer
- On your turn, **choose all tiles of 1 color** from:
  - A factory display, or
  - The center of the table.
- If from a factory:
  - Move the **remaining tiles** from that factory to the **center**.
- If you are the first to take from the center:
  - Also take the **First Player marker** and place it in your **floor line**.
- Place your chosen tiles in **one pattern line** on your board:
  - Only 1 color allowed per line.
  - Any excess tiles go to the **floor line** (penalty area).

Repeat until **all tiles are drafted**.

---

### 2. Wall-Tiling Phase
- For each completed pattern line (filled row):
  - Move **1 tile** to the matching position on your wall.
  - Return unused tiles to the **box lid** (not the bag).
- Scoring:
  - Each placed tile scores:
    - **1 point** if no adjacent tiles.
    - **+1 per adjacent tile** horizontally/vertically in that row/column.
- Tiles in the floor line cause **negative points**:
  - 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3 penalty (for positions 1–7).

---

### 3. Preparation for Next Round
- If no one has completed a horizontal line on their wall:
  - Refill factories: draw **4 tiles per factory** from the bag.
  - If bag is empty → refill from discarded tiles in box lid.
- If at least one player has completed a **horizontal line of 5 tiles**:
  - The game ends after this Wall-Tiling phase.

---

## End of Game Scoring
At the end of the game, players score additional points:
- +2 points per **complete horizontal row**.
- +7 points per **complete vertical column**.
- +10 points per **complete set of all 5 tiles of one color**.

The player with the **most points wins**.
Ties are broken by the player with the most completed rows.
